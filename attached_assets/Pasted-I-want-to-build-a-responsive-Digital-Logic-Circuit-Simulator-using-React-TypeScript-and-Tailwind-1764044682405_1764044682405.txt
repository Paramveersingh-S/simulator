I want to build a responsive "Digital Logic Circuit Simulator" using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. 

### **Core Concept**
A web-based educational tool where students select a digital experiment (e.g., "Full Adder", "Shift Register") and interact with a realistic visual representation of the circuit. 
- They toggle "DIP Switches" (Inputs).
- They see the signal travel through "Wires" (SVG lines).
- They watch "LEDs" light up (Outputs).
- A central "IC Chip" performs the logic.

### **Design & Responsiveness (CRITICAL)**
1.  **Mobile-First Approach:** - On mobile: The layout must stack vertically. The sidebar (experiment list) goes to the top or becomes a dropdown. The circuit board scales down or becomes horizontally scrollable.
    - On Desktop: A split-screen layout (Sidebar on left, Simulator on right).
2.  **Visual Style (Skeuomorphic):**
    - Dark mode aesthetics (Slate-900 background).
    - The components (Switches, LEDs, Chips) should look 3D with CSS shadows.
    - Wires should be drawn using SVG lines that connect specific coordinates on the board. 
    - Wires must "glow" (change color/brightness) when their carrying signal is HIGH.

### **The 10 Experiments (Simplified Academic Names)**
Do not use real-world names like "Smart Home" or "Parking Lot". Use standard Digital Electronics names:
1.  **Basic Logic Gates:** Implementation of AND/OR logic. Inputs: A, B, C. Output: Y.
2.  **Full Adder:** Binary addition circuit. Inputs: A, B, Cin. Outputs: Sum, Cout.
3.  **2:1 Multiplexer:** Data routing. Inputs: Select, In0, In1. Output: Y.
4.  **4-to-2 Priority Encoder:** Inputs: I0, I1, I2, I3. Outputs: Y1, Y0.
5.  **SR Latch (Lockout Circuit):** Sequential logic. Inputs: Set1, Set2, Set3, Reset. Outputs: Q1, Q2, Q3.
6.  **4-Bit Synchronous Counter:** Counts 0-15. Inputs: CountUp, CountDown. Outputs: Q3, Q2, Q1, Q0.
7.  **8-Bit Shift Register (SIPO):** Serial-In Parallel-Out. Inputs: Clock, Data. Outputs: Q0-Q7.
8.  **Sequence Detector (101):** Detects pattern "1-0-1". Inputs: Clock, Bit, Reset. Output: Detected.
9.  **Finite State Machine (Accumulator):** Adds values until overflow. Inputs: Add1, Add2, Reset. Outputs: Overflow, Carry.
10. **Traffic Light Controller (Timer):** Cyclic state machine. Inputs: Clock, Override. Outputs: 6 LEDs (R/Y/G for 2 directions).

### **Technical Requirements**
1.  **State Management:** Use `useState` and `useEffect`. 
2.  **Clock Signal:** For sequential experiments (Counter, Shift Register), implement a `setInterval` that runs automatically. Visually toggle the "Clock" switch on the UI so the student sees the pulse.
3.  **Single File Structure:** If possible, keep the logic and UI in `App.tsx` or separate logically into `experiments.ts` for configuration.
4.  **No Backend:** All logic must run client-side in the browser.
